Functional Dependencies:
Book_ID → Title, Price, Author_ID, Publisher_ID
Author_ID → Name, Email
Publisher_ID → Name, Address
Normalization to 3NF:
All tables already:
*Have atomic attributes
*No partial dependency (as all are in 1NF & 2NF)
*All non-key attributes depend only on primary key
* Thus, schema is in 3NF
